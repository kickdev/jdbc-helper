#summary Using JdbcHelper in maven

= Introduction =

A request has been made for JdbcHelper version 0.3 to be included in the central maven repository, until then you have to install JdbcHelper to your local maven repository.

=Installing JdbcHelper to your local maven repository=

First you need to checkout the version 0.3 source code:
{{{
svn checkout http://jdbc-helper.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.3/ jdbc-helper-0.3
}}}

Then change to the jdbc-helper-0.3 directory and type:
{{{
mvn clean source:jar javadoc:jar install
}}}

This will install the version 0.3 to your local maven repository along with the sources and the javadoc.

=Depending on JdbcHelper=
You can add a dependency to the library by adding the following xml to the `<dependencies>` section of your pom.xml file:

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>jdbc-helper</groupId>
    <artifactId>jdbc-helper</artifactId>
    <version>0.3</version>
</dependency>
}}}

You should also depend on the corresponding SLF4J package based which logging framework that you are using.

For instance:
{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
     <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
     <version>1.5.8</version>
</dependency>
}}}
